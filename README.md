# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2023** repository! This has been my first journey with Advent of Code (AoC), and my original plan was to solve each problem as it was released. However, after a while, I started to slip in my solving progress, and the goal shifted to solving all the problems whenever I had the time. This repo will serve as a showcase of my problem-solving abilities, coding skills, and dedication to continuous learning.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is an annual event featuring a series of daily programming challenges that are released every year during the month of December (from December 1st to 25th). The challenges cover a wide range of computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and optimization, making it a great platform to sharpen coding skills.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge will be solved using **Python**, and the solution code will be organized as follows (Note: I created this structure after day 5):

```bash
adventofcode/
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.test    # Puzzle test input for Day 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.in      # Puzzle input for Day 1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1.py      # Solution code for Day 1
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2.test    
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2.in      
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2.py      
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ Day 25/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 25.test    
    â”œâ”€â”€ 25.in      
    â””â”€â”€ 25.py
```
##### File Structure
- **1.test**: The test input provided by Advent of Code in the description.
- **1.in**:   The input provided by Advent of Code for the puzzle.
- **1.py**:   My code solution for that day's problem.
###### (sometimes added) 
- README.md: A brief explanation of my approach to solving the problem, and the concepts or algorithms used.

## Goals
Learning and Growth: This is my first time attempting AoC, and Iâ€™m using this opportunity to expand my skills in competitive programming, algorithms, and optimization techniques.
Documentation and Clean Code: I'll focus on writing clean, readable, and well-documented code. Each solution will include comments and a brief overview of the approach taken.
Performance: While correctness is a priority, I'll also aim to improve the efficiency of my solutions where applicable.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling daily coding challenges with various levels of difficulty.
- **Algorithms**: Applying standard and custom algorithms to solve puzzles.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizing data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, graphs, etc., to address the needs of each problem.
- **Code Efficiency**: Optimizing solutions to meet performance constraints.
- **Testing**: Ensuring each solution works correctly with different input cases.

## Progress
| Day  | Puzzle Title         | Difficulty  | Solution Link                         |
|------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Day 1| Sample Puzzle Title   |          | [Solution](https://github.com/SebastianGranath/adventofcode/blob/master/Day%201/day1.py)              |
| Day 2| Another Puzzle Title  |        | [Solution](./Day 1/1.py)              |
| Day 3| Yet Another Puzzle    |          | [Solution](./Day 1/1.py)              |

(This table will be updated daily as I complete each puzzle)

## Running the Code
To run a particular day's solution, navigate to the specific dayâ€™s folder and execute the script.
If you want to alternate between the test input and the puzzle input, change the file ending in the line importing the data. 
- "*.test": test input
- '*.in": acctual puzzle input
