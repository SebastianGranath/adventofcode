# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! I really enjoy the problem-solving in this challenge, and it seems that almost every puzzle teaches me something new. I would be stoked to be on the international scoreboard, but realistically, I aim to solve each problem without slipping!

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is an annual event featuring a series of daily programming challenges released every year during the month of December (from December 1st to 25th). The challenges cover a wide range of computer science concepts, such as algorithms, data structures, and optimization, making it a great platform to sharpen coding skills.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge will be solved using **Python**, and the solution code will be organized as follows (Note: I created this structure after Day 5):

```bash
adventofcode/
├── 2024/
│   ├── Day 1/
│   │   ├── 1.test    # Puzzle test input for Day 1
│   │   ├── 1.in      # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   │   └── 1.py      # Solution code for Day 1
│   ├── Day 2/
│   │   ├── 2.test    
│   │   ├── 2.in      
│   │   └── 2.py      
│   ├── ...
│   └── Day 25/
│       ├── 25.test    
│       ├── 25.in      
│       └── 25.py
```
##### File Structure
- **1.test**: The test input provided by Advent of Code in the description.
- **1.in**:   The input provided by Advent of Code for the puzzle.
- **1.py**:   My code solution for that day's problem.
- **README.md**: A brief explanation of my approach to solving the problem, and the concepts or algorithms used.

## Goals
Learning and Growth: I’m using this challenge to expand my skills in competitive programming, algorithms, and optimization techniques.
Documentation and Clean Code: I'll focus on writing clean, readable, and well-documented code. Each solution will include comments and a brief overview of the approach taken.
Performance: While correctness is a priority, I'll also aim to improve the efficiency of my solutions where applicable.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling daily coding challenges with various levels of difficulty.
- **Algorithms**: Applying standard and custom algorithms to solve puzzles.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizing data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, graphs, etc., to address the needs of each problem.
- **Code Efficiency**: Optimizing solutions to meet performance constraints.
- **Testing**: Ensuring each solution works correctly with different input cases.

## Running the Code
To run a particular day's solution, navigate to the specific day’s folder and execute the script.
If you want to alternate between the test input and the puzzle input, change the file ending in the line importing the data. 
- "*.test": test input
- "*.in": actual puzzle input
